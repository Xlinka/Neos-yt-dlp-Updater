# yt-dlp Updater

yt-dlp Updater is a C# console application that makes it easy to update the `yt-dlp.exe` file in the NeosVR or Steam installation directories (or a custom directory of your choice). The application prompts the user for input and then automatically runs the `yt-dlp.exe -U` command to update the `yt-dlp.exe` file.

## Getting Started

To use the yt-dlp Updater application, simply download the latest release from the GitHub repository and extract the files to a directory of your choice.

## Usage

To run the yt-dlp Updater application, open a command prompt or PowerShell window in the directory where the application files are located, and then type the following command:

yt-dlp-updater.exe or ./yt-dlp-updater.exe


The application will prompt you for input in the console window. Follow the prompts to update the `yt-dlp.exe` file in the NeosVR or Steam installation directories, or a custom directory of your choice.

Note that the application assumes that the `yt-dlp.exe` file is in a subdirectory named "RuntimeData". If the `yt-dlp.exe` file is in a different directory, you can specify a custom path when prompted.
